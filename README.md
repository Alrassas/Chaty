# Chaty
Chaty is an anonymous chat app that allows millions of users to chat at the same time.

Firebase is Google's real time NoSQL Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that can stream data to millions of users at the same time through the power of Websockets!

This app demonstrates how a powerful chat app can be made without any backend code.
